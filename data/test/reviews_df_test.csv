I am shopping for Amazon.com gift cards for Christmas gifts and am really so disappointed that out of five choices there isn't one that says ""Merry Christmas"" or mentions Christmas at all!  I am sure I am not alone in wanting a card that reflects the actual ""holiday"" we are celebrating. On principle, I cannot send a Amazon gift card this Christmas.  What's up with all the Political Correctness?  Bad marketing decision.

It's very convenient and indeed a great gift. I found paper gift cards annoying since you have to always wonder how much money you got left on it. And if you lose it, you lose it. An electronic delivery of the gift card makes it a lot of easier to redeem, you only need to COPY/PASTE the code into your gift certificate balance and it'll be there whenever you want to use it.

I've sent friends electronic gift cards via email for their newborns, for their weddings, and for their housewarmings. :)

Also, you spend time and headache buying these types of cards, dealing with any activation issues risking expiration or delivery issues and then you have to keep up with them and keep track of how much you have remaining on the card....

They should at least give a discount for committing your purchasing power to them...",Give CASH!,1229472000,
